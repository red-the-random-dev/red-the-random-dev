- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @red-the-random-dev
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in development for .NET platform (and desktop in general) and development of game mods (especially Barotrauma)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and specifics of Unity engine

So much for the templated introduction.
What do I do most time? I do some useful projects for .NET platform I chose because of C# being favored by me pretty much. It is a nice language with lots of fields of application.

Sometimes I shitpost, come to see some of it: \[link addition pending\].

If you are the bold enough to see the world of my crap coding, feel free to visit some of my repos. I can already see all of that critique.
